Scripts used to read xCO2 data from an automated flowing pCO2 measuring system from General Oceanics Inc. Model 8050 with a LI-7810.

Clone to local folder and use uv run process_data.py in for instance pycharm. Make sure to update which data folder that contains xCO2 data within this script (see line 14). If you have access to \\Winfs\data\prod\Obs_Oceanografi\Arkiv\Ferrybox\txt, no further actions required. Otherwise you also need to specify location of the ferrybox files in process_data.py (see line 35), that also need to have channel headers used by SMHI. Associated quality controlled ferrybox data will be automatically retrieved, only acceptable data will be used. The scripts are built for the data maintenance within SMHI.
